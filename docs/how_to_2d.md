# How To (2D)


## Make SVG
use your tool of choice.
- I've heard inkscape is good
- using any photo editing tool and then converting to svg (web tool [here](https://www.pngtosvg.com/))

## Make GCODE
use [this](http://jscut.org/jscut.html) tool.

## Setup Machine
place the block firmly attached to the board
- for small blocks use the clamp
- for big sheets clamp or screw to table

## Mill
- manually drive the bit to the top left corner of your work, barely touching the material.
- zero out the machine
- manually drive the bit to the bottom left of the work (as seen in the UI)
- make sure it will fit the material
- home XY, then home Z
- turn on the spindle

- press play
